# Loktra Front-end Challenge

## Our goal

We want to see how smart, dedicated and passionate you are about programming.We'll be checking in on you throughout the interview asking you what you're doing and why you're doing it and providing feedback where we feel it might help you. 

## Your task

The challenge before you is to create a simple news website using the [News API](http://www.newsapi.org/). The main focus should be on good UI. The target MVP should have:

* A big top view with changing top stories from various outlets
* A few lists of news stories from the above outlets
* The individual list items should flip on hover showing description of the news and on click should take us to the news
* Use responsive design to make the site work well on mobile

## Stretch goals

If you get the basic app done with time to spare, then tackle whichever of these secondary objectives tickle your fancy. Or make up one of your own if you have a cool idea you want to try!

<!--* Create a simple back-end for storing user's library data-->
* Create different filters based on the parameters provided in the apis 
* Add the ability for the user to pin stories they might want to see later
* Make the locally pinned stories appear in a side drawer
* Allow the news articles to be dragged to the side drawer to pin them
* Add some cool animations to the dragged item while being dragged
* Show us your css prowess, we really want to see that. Go Crazy!
<!--* Add a Graphs view that presents interesting information about the user's library, e.g. most common actors in your movies, number of your movies by decade, etc.-->

## General bonus points

As you tackle this topic there are a few general things that would be nice to see (though by no means necessary):

* Commit your work frequently to a repository
* Design a simple UI with good usability


We'll try to check in on your periodically, but please feel free to ask us any clarifying questions that may arise or just ask us for feedback on the direction you're going.
