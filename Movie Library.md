# Loktra Front-end Challenge

## Our goal

We want to see how you make decisions, solve problems, and handle feedback. We'll be checking in on you throughout the interview asking you what you're doing and why you're doing it and providing feedback where we feel it might help you.

## Your task

The challenge before you is to create a simple movie library management tool using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to access movie data. The target MVP has two views:

* Search view
 * The user can search for a movie by name and see a list of results
 * The user can add a movie to their personal library
* Library view
 * The user can see a list of the movies added to their library

Feel free to use something simple like `localStorage` to store which movies the user has in their library.

## Stretch goals

If you get the basic app done with time to spare, then tackle whichever of these secondary objectives tickle your fancy. Or make up one of your own if you have a cool idea you want to try!

* Create a simple back-end for storing user's library data
* Add the ability to add reviews and/or star ratings to movies
* Add multi-user capability by letting the user sign-in with an email (don't bother with passwords for the sake of time)
* Use responsive design to make the site work well on mobile
* Add a Graphs view that presents interesting information about the user's library, e.g. most common actors in your movies, number of your movies by decade, etc.

## General bonus points

As you tackle this topic there are a few general things that would be nice to see (though by no means necessary):

* Commit your work frequently to a repository
* Design a simple UI with good usability


We'll try to check in on your periodically, but please feel free to ask us any clarifying questions that may arise or just ask us for feedback on the direction you're going.
